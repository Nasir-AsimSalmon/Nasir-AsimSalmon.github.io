### CPSC 120


#### **Lab 1**  

* Lab 1 was one of my favorite introductory labs for understanding the structure of C++. The lab provided me with foundational knowledge and hands-on experience in using C++, but introduced me to using basic commands for Linux, BASH Shell, and being able to explore and push code that I had produced into GitHub. What I love about this introductory Lab is that it allowed me to gain more knowledge regarding C++ by trying to print out “Hello World!”, but also allowed me to work together with someone in order to explore different pathways and understand the different layers that go into coding.

#### **Lab 6**  
*  Lab 6, part 1 was a fun experience for me as it provided me an opportunity to not only grasp the understanding of MadLibs, but for me to discern patterns and create patterns within my code. The program generated sentences describing a sandwich order based on the arguments it was given. This particular project was interesting to me because it gave me an opportunity to work with someone in order to create patterns and find different ways to go about writing the code, but it also helped me understand arguments more.

#### **Lab 7**   
* Lab 7, part 1, stands out as a particularly fun experience for me. The lab introduced me to the Julian day calculation, a new method which allowed me to calculate the number of days between two dates. The code itself had structured around command line arguments for things such as start and end dates. This particular lab was such a fun experience for me because it allowed for me to find command line arguments which would match this Julian day calculation, and finally putting that together was an achieving process.
