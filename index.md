### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 
https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-01-mark-nasir.git 
    Lab 1 was one of my favorite introductory labs for understanding the structure used within C++. With this it also allowed me to get a glimpse into the syntax of C++. This ultimately helped me understand the components and where everything goes into creating “Hello World!”.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was a fun experience for me as it provided me an opportunity to discern a pattern within coding. In doing this it helped me precisely list the condiments used in crafting a sandwich. Finding out the correct pattern was a really fun experience for me and my partner. 

* Lab 7 
https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-07-nathen-and-nasir.git
    Lab 7, part 1 was another favorite lab of mine. The lab introduced me to the Julian day calculation, which helped me determine the number of days between two dates. I found this particular approach in finding dates really interesting.
